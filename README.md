# fs.lib /// maxlib-felthiv

Libray of abstraction and tools for sound design and music making.</br>
Made with Max8

This is simply an effort to centralise code ressources I might use often.
Mostly my stuff but I hsamelessly borrow from other people stuff and the max tutorials.
The idea is to have de basic buiding blocks centralised somewhere (most of them).
This also some stuff that has been done countless times and is by no means anything special.

Cheers!
